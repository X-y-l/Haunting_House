# Haunting House
A godot game for the GMTK game jam, using the theme "Roles Reversed".
You are in a haunted house, but instead of getting spooked, you are the one who needs to do the spooking!
Control sound effects and events from a panel in the basement to target individual fears to build tension, and then when their spook-o-meter is maxxed out, jumpscare them to win points.
